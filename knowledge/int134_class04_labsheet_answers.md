### Part 1 - A database server is a server

The misconception this part attacks: that a database is something your
application
contains. It is a separate server, with its own process, its own port, its
own users
and its own idea of who may do what. Your application is one of its clients.
The names you need. Everything else in this part you have already done, in
classes 1, 2
and 3 — installing a package, reading a unit's two states, reading a
listening port. Recall
those rather than looking them up, and look them up rather than being stuck.

Name                         │ What it is
──────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────
mysql-server                │ the package — the database server itself
mysql                       │ the service that package installs
sudo mysql                  │ connect as the server's administrator
mysql -u <user> -p          │ connect as somebody else, with a password

1. Install the package. Then establish three things about what you have just
installed:
that the service is enabled, that it is active, and which version of MySQL
it
is. What does the active state say? →  T1 Compare that with class 3. The web
server was installed and did not start itself;
you had to. Two packages, two different decisions by two different packagers
— which is
exactly why "installed" and "running" are separate questions and you check
both.The version is not idle curiosity. This course expects MySQL 8, which
is what the
distribution's own package gives you on Ubuntu 24.04, and the checker says
so if it
finds anything else. Knowing the version of what you have deployed is the
first thing
anyone asks you when it misbehaves.
2. Find the database's port and look carefully at the address it is bound to.
Which address is it? →  T2
$ ss -tln
State  Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port
LISTEN 0      151         <...>:3306          0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN 0      70          <...>:33060         0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN 0      511         0.0.0.0:80          0.0.0.0:*
Your web server is on  0.0.0.0  — every address on the machine. The database
is not,
and the difference is the whole of this step. Class 3 taught you to read
this column;
this is the first time it says something different about two services on one
machine.
3. Given that address, does the database need a firewall rule of its own so
that your
application can reach it? →  T3 Think before you answer, and say why to
yourself. Your application runs on this same
machine. Where does its connection to the database actually travel?A
database on the public internet is one of the most common ways organisations
lose
everything at once. This one cannot be reached from outside, and you did not
have to do
anything to make that true — but you do have to know it, because in class 8
you will be
the one deciding.
4. Connect as the server's administrator, then try again as yourself. What
does the second
attempt say? →  T4
$ sudo mysql -e "SELECT VERSION();"
+-------------------------+
| VERSION()               |
+-------------------------+
| 8.0.46-0ubuntu0.24.04.3 |
+-------------------------+
$ mysql -e "SELECT 1;"
<...>
sudo mysql  needs no password: the administrator account is tied to the
operating
system user rather than to a password, so being root on this machine is
enough. That is
a decision about trust, and it is why your application must not connect that
way.



--------

### Part 2 - A database, a user that owns only it, and the data it holds

The misconception this part attacks: that an application connects to "the
database" as
an administrator. It should not, and the reason is not politeness. An
application that can
only touch its own data cannot destroy anything else when it is wrong — or
when somebody
else is driving it.

Statement                          │ What it does
────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────
CREATE DATABASE <name> CHARACTER  │ Make a database that can hold any
SET utf8mb4                        │ character
CREATE USER '<u>'@'localhost' IDE │ Make a user, and let the server
NTIFIED BY RANDOM PASSWORD         │ choose the password
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <db>.* TO │ Let that user do anything in that
'<u>'@'localhost'                 │ one database
SHOW GRANTS FOR '<u>'@'localhost' │ What may this user actually do?
SHOW DATABASES                    │ Which databases can I see?

5. Read the three scripts before you run any of them. They came with the
application,
in  db/ , and between them they build everything the database side of today
needs.
$ ls /srv/school/db
schema.sql  seed.sql  setup.sql
$ cat /srv/school/db/setup.sql

Script       │ What it makes                         │ Run as
──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────
setup.sql   │ the database, the user, and its grant │ the administrator
schema.sql  │ the table                             │ the  school  user
seed.sql    │ the rows that start the register      │ the  school  user
Only the first needs the administrator, and that is the shape of every
deployment you
will meet: one privileged step that creates an account, and then everything
else done
as that account. If your application's user cannot build its own table, it
is not
really the owner of its own data.Reading them first is the habit, not the
ceremony. These are short and you can check
them in half a minute — but the day arrives when the script is four hundred
lines and
came from somebody else, and the half-minute you did not spend then is the
whole of the
story.Why scripts at all, when you could type the statements? Because typing
produces a
deployment nobody can reproduce, including you, in six months. A script can
be read
before it runs, reviewed by somebody who is not you, kept in version control
beside the
code it belongs to, and run identically on the next machine. You will see
the same
argument again in class 8 and class 10, about bigger things. utf8mb4  in
setup.sql  is the character set that can actually store every character,
including Thai and emoji. The older  utf8  in MySQL cannot, and choosing it
is a bug you
discover months later when somebody's name will not save. This server's
default is
already  utf8mb4 , so the clause changes nothing today — it is written
anyway, because
the default lives in a file somebody can edit and the next machine may not
be this one.
State what you depend on.
6. Run the first of them as the server's administrator — and let the server
choose the
password. Then put that password straight into  db/school.env , because you
will not
be shown it twice.
$ sudo mysql < /srv/school/db/setup.sql
user        host    generated password      auth_factor
school      localhost       <twenty characters>     1

$ install -m 600 /dev/null /srv/school/db/school.env
$ nano /srv/school/db/school.env
$ ls -l /srv/school/db/school.env
-rw------- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 81 Aug 26 14:05 /srv/school/db/school.env
Three lines go in it, and the third is the one that matters:
SCHOOL_USER=school
SCHOOL_DATABASE=school
SCHOOL_PASSWORD='<the twenty characters, exactly as printed>'

│ Exactly as printed. This file holds the password the way the server thinks
│ of it. Later today you will make a second, encoded copy for the
│ application, and
│ that one belongs in  backend/.env  and nowhere else. Put the encoded form
│ in here and
│ every  mysql  command you run afterwards answers  Access denied  — which
│ sends people
│ off to inspect the GRANT, where nothing is wrong.
Mode 600 before there is anything in it. The same  install  you met in setup
step
5, making a file this time rather than a directory:  /dev/null  is what it
copies, so what
arrives is an empty file at exactly the mode you asked for — in one command,
with no moment
in between. Do it the other way round and the file exists, with a password
in it, at
whatever permissions you happened to get. A password every account on the
machine can read
is not a password.The single quotes are doing real work. A generated
password is twenty characters
from a large alphabet and can easily contain  $ ,  &  or  * . In single
quotes the shell
hands them over untouched; in double quotes, or none, you get something else.
A
generated password can never contain a single quote itself, so this is
always safe.No box drawn round  mysql 's output this time. It prints an
ASCII table when it is
talking to a terminal and plain tab-separated columns when it is not, and
here its input
is a file. Same data, and the second form is the one you can pipe into
something else. RANDOM PASSWORD  is not a convenience. A password you invent
for a service is one you
will reuse, type into the wrong window, or make short enough to remember.
This one is
twenty characters, no human ever memorises it, and it lives in exactly one
file with the
permissions to match. That is what a service credential should look like.
'school'@'localhost'  is one user: the name and where it may connect from.
The same
name from another host would be a different user, and does not exist.You
will see  FLUSH PRIVILEGES  after a  GRANT  in about half the tutorials on
the
internet, and it is not in this script.  GRANT  takes effect immediately.
That command is
only needed when somebody has edited the server's grant tables directly,
which is not
something you should ever be doing.
│ This password goes in that one file on your VM and nowhere else. Not in
│  answers.yaml  — nothing on this sheet asks for it. Not in a message to a
│ friend. Not
│ in a file you will commit to git in class 6.

7. Ask the server what that user may do. There are two lines. What is the
scope of the
second one — what does it apply to? →  T7
$ sudo mysql -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'school'@'localhost';"
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for school@localhost                                |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `school`@`localhost`                 |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <...> TO `school`@`localhost`      |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
USAGE ON *.*  looks alarming and is not: it means "may connect, and nothing
else". It
is how MySQL says the user exists. Every actual permission is on the second
line.
8. Now stop being the administrator. Load the credential file into your
shell and
connect as the application's own user. The server keeps its own accounts in
a database
called  mysql  — can you see it? →  T8
$ set -a; . /srv/school/db/school.env; set +a
$ MYSQL_PWD="$SCHOOL_PASSWORD" mysql -u "$SCHOOL_USER" -e "SHOW DATABASES;
"
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| performance_schema |
| school             |
+--------------------+
This is what the grant bought you. If this application is ever broken into,
the damage
stops at its own data — the attacker inherits exactly these privileges and
no more.What those first two lines actually do.  .  (a dot, the same as
source ) runs the
file in this shell rather than a new one, so the variables it sets survive
the
command.  set -a  marks everything defined while it is on for export, so
they reach the
programs you run afterwards, and  set +a  turns that off again. This is the
same
KEY=value  file format as  .env , and as  EnvironmentFile=  in a systemd
unit, and as
the environment section of a Compose file in class 8. One syntax, read by
four
different things.And the password never appears on a command line.
MYSQL_PWD=<value> <command>  is
a shell prefix assignment: it puts the variable into the environment of that
one
command and nowhere else — not into this shell, and not into the next thing
you run. What
you type is  "$SCHOOL_PASSWORD" , so that is what your history file keeps.
And  ps , which
shows every account on this machine the full command line of every process,
has nothing to
show, because the password was never on one.You could type it instead.
mysql -u school -p , with nothing after the  -p , asks
at the keyboard, and that is perfectly correct. It is not what we do here
because the
password is twenty random characters and you are about to need it four times.
It is in a
file precisely so that you do not retype it.
│ MySQL's own manual calls  MYSQL_PWD  insecure. Read why, then read your
│ platform.
│ The warning is about systems where one account can read another's
│ environment. On Linux
│ it cannot:  /proc/<pid>/environ  is mode  -r-------- , owner only, and a
│ second
│ unprivileged account is simply refused. What you must never do is the form
│ that looks
│ tidiest —  mysql -p<password> , the password stuck to the flag — because a
│ command line
│ really is readable by everyone through  ps , and it goes into your history
│ as well.
│ Know which of your platform's guarantees you are leaning on, and you can
│ tell the
│ difference between a warning that applies to you and one that does not.

9. Build the table and load the register — as that same user, because it
owns this
database and that is what owning it means.
$ MYSQL_PWD="$SCHOOL_PASSWORD" mysql -u "$SCHOOL_USER" "$SCHOOL_DATABASE"
\
-e "source /srv/school/db/schema.sql"
$ MYSQL_PWD="$SCHOOL_PASSWORD" mysql -u "$SCHOOL_USER" "$SCHOOL_DATABASE"
\
-e "source /srv/school/db/seed.sql"
Two ways to run a script, and you have now used both. At step 6 the shell
fed
the file in —  sudo mysql < setup.sql , a redirection — and that still works
here:
... mysql -u "$SCHOOL_USER" "$SCHOOL_DATABASE" < /srv/school/db/schema.sql
does the same
job.  source  is the client's own command for it, and it depends on no shell
at all:
the same word works when you are sitting at a  mysql>  prompt with no shell
in reach,
which is where you will find yourself on somebody else's machine one day.And
when a script fails halfway, they do not say the same thing. Redirection
reports  ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 2: .  source  reports  ERROR 1146
(42S02) at line 2 in
file: '/srv/school/db/seed.sql':  — the same error, plus the one fact you
actually
want when you have just run two scripts one after the other. Both stop at
the first
failing statement and both exit non-zero, so neither lets a half-loaded
schema look like
success. Try it: put a typo in a copy of one of these files and run it.Then
look at what you loaded. How many rows are on the register, and what is the
major
of student  68130500460 ? →  T9
$ MYSQL_PWD="$SCHOOL_PASSWORD" mysql -u "$SCHOOL_USER" "$SCHOOL_DATABASE"
\
-e "SELECT * FROM students;"
Neither script needed  sudo , and neither needed the administrator. That is
the
grant from step 6 doing its job — not a restriction you worked around, a
boundary you
worked inside.Two files, and not one.  schema.sql  owns the shape of the
data;  seed.sql
owns the data. A schema change and a data load are different operations with
different risks, and you will meet deployments where one is allowed and the
other is
not.  seed.sql  begins with a  DELETE , which is safe on a register nobody
has used yet
and would not be safe on one somebody had — knowing that before rather than
after is
the habit worth having.Nothing here is Prisma, and nothing here needed it.
An application's database is made of
SQL statements, and a tool that writes them for you is a convenience, not a
requirement.
You will meet the tool in Part 3, and it will be joining a database that
already exists.
10. Now connect to the same database from MySQL Workbench on your own
computer, over
SSH. Which host did you give as the MySQL Hostname? →  T10 In Workbench,
make a new connection with Connection Method: Standard TCP/IP over
SSH, and fill in seven fields:
Field              │ Value
────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SSH Hostname       │  <your-vm>.sit.kmutt.ac.th:22
SSH Username       │  sysadmin
SSH Password       │ your VM password
MySQL Hostname     │  <...>
MySQL Server Port  │  3306
Username           │  school
Password           │ the generated password from step 6 — Store in Vault
Then Test Connection, open it, and look at the  students  table you built
two steps
ago — the rows are there, and this is the first time today you have seen
your database
from outside a terminal.Two hostnames in one dialog, and they are not the
same machine — that is what this step
is for. Workbench logs into your VM over SSH first, and then, from inside
your VM,
opens a database connection. So the MySQL hostname is whatever the database
looks like
from your VM's point of view, which is step 2's answer arriving again from a
different
direction.This is also the answer to "but the database is not on the network,
so how do I ever look
at it?" You do not expose it. You reach it through a channel you already
have. Every
production database you will meet is reached like this.



--------

### Part 3 - The application, its dependencies, and its schema

The misconception this part attacks: that deploying a program means copying
it onto a
machine. A program arrives with a list of things it needs, a description of
the tables it
expects, and no way to run until both have been dealt with.

Command                   │ What it does
───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────
npm ci                   │ Install dependencies exactly as recorded
npm install              │ Install dependencies, and update the record
npx prisma migrate dev   │ Write a new migration from the schema — a
│ developer's command
npx prisma migrate diff  │ Compare what the database is against what
│ the code expects
npx prisma generate      │ Build the database client the code imports

Your database already exists — you built it in Part 2, out of SQL, with no
tool's help.
So Prisma is the client here and not the author, and the two commands that
matter are
the last two.

11. Install Node.js 24 from the NodeSource repository — the same three moves
as class 3:
fetch the key, add the repository, install.
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key \
| sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.
nodesource.com/node_24.x nodistro main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs
$ node --version ; npm --version
v24.19.0
11.17.0
The distribution's own  nodejs  is version 18, which stopped receiving
security fixes
in April 2025. Deploying an unsupported runtime is a decision, and this is
the second
time this course has made you make it deliberately.Why 24 and not 22, or 26?
Node's even-numbered releases become long-term support
lines, and each one is "active" for a year before dropping to security fixes
only. Today
24 is the active one; 22 went to security-only in October 2025 and ends in
April 2027;
26 came out in May and is not an LTS line until October. The rule is worth
more than the
numbers: for something you have to keep running, take the newest release
that has
finished being new.
12. Install the application's dependencies — then find out what makes  npm
ci  different
from  npm install . Delete  package-lock.json , run  npm ci  again, and read
the
refusal. What does it require? →  T12
$ cd /srv/school/backend
$ npm ci
added 105 packages in 6s
npm warn allow-scripts 3 packages have install scripts not yet covered <...
>

$ cp package-lock.json /tmp/
$ rm package-lock.json
$ npm ci
npm error code EUSAGE
npm error
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing <...> or
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfile version 2 or higher.

$ cp /tmp/package-lock.json .
$ npm ci
That warning is new in npm 11 and it is not an error — nothing failed. Some
packages
ask to run a script of their own at install time, and npm has stopped doing
that
silently. Prisma is one of them; you build its client yourself at step 18,
so there is
nothing here you need to approve. Read the warning anyway: a package that
runs code on
your machine merely because you installed it is worth being asked about.
Taking the copy first is the habit, not a detail of this step. You are
breaking
something on purpose on a machine with no undo — and from class 6 there is a
repository
here that would have kept it for you, which is most of why you will want one.
That file records the exact version of all 105 packages, including the ones
your
dependencies depend on.  npm install  may quietly pick newer ones;  npm ci
refuses to
guess. On a deployment you want the version you tested, not the version that
exists
today — which is why the lockfile is committed and why this is the command
to use.
13. The application needs to know where its database is, how to log in, and
which port to
listen on. Create its configuration from the example beside it, and make
sure nobody
else on the machine can read it.
$ cp .env.example .env
$ chmod 600 .env
$ nano .env
$ ls -l .env
-rw------- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 3965 Aug 26 14:20 .env
Fill in four values. Put the password in raw, exactly as it stands in
db/school.env  — we will deal with it properly in two steps' time:
DATABASE_URL="mysql://school:<the generated password>@127.0.0.
1:3306/school"
STUDENT_ID="<your 11-digit student number>"
PORT=<your port — 3 and the last three digits of your VM's name>
HOST=0.0.0.0

│ Not  ${SCHOOL_PASSWORD} . You have the password in a file two directories
│ away,
│ and writing  mysql://school:${SCHOOL_PASSWORD}@…  here is the obvious next
│ thought.
│ Do not. Two different programs read this file and they do not agree about
│ ${...} :
│
│  reads  .env                        │ expands  ${VAR} ?
│ ────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────
│  the Prisma CLI — every             │ yes
│   npx prisma …                      │
│  systemd, at  EnvironmentFile=  in  │ no — it hands over all eighteen
│  Part 4                             │ characters, exactly as typed
│
│ So it works every way you are likely to test it this afternoon, and fails
│ the one way
│ the application is actually run. A configuration file that behaves
│ differently
│ depending on who opened it is the worst kind there is, and you would be
│ debugging it at
│ step 19 with nothing on screen to suggest why.
│
│ There is a second reason, and it would still stand even if systemd did
│ expand:
│ substitution cannot percent-encode.  ${SCHOOL_PASSWORD}  would put the
│ password in
│ raw — which is exactly the problem the next three steps are about.
600  means the owner may read and write it and nobody else may do anything.
A file
with a password in it that everybody can read is not a secret. There is a  .
gitignore
beside it naming this very file, for the same reason: from class 6 this
directory
becomes a repository, and a password committed to one is public for ever —
even after
you delete it. chmod 600  before you edit, not after. In between, the file
exists with the
password in it and the permissions the copy gave it. HOST  decides which
addresses the application listens on, and the example file's
default —  127.0.0.1 , this machine and nothing else — is the one you want
to end up
with. You are overriding it today because today there is nothing in front of
the
application: at step 25 you reach it from your own computer, which cannot be
done
through a loopback address. In class 5 nginx takes that job, the API goes
back to
127.0.0.1 , and port 80 is the only way in — which is where a deployed
application
belongs. Overriding a safe default is a decision, not a step; it is worth
knowing which
ones you have open.
14. Ask Prisma to set the database up, using the command every tutorial on
the internet
gives you.
$ npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": MySQL database
It will not finish — and it will not fail the same way for everybody in the
room.
Which failure you get depends on the password the server happened to
generate for you.
About one of you in five gets this:
Error: <...>: The provided database string is invalid. <...> in database
URL.
Please refer to the documentation ... In some cases, certain characters
must be
escaped. Please check the string for any illegal characters.
Most of the rest get something longer that mentions a shadow database —
which is
step 16's subject, and a different problem entirely. There is a rare third
possibility
—  Access denied , with no complaint about the URL at all — and step 15
explains that
one too. It is the nastiest of the three.Which error code did yours stop on,
and in one sentence, what was it refusing to
do? →  T14 If you got the first one: nothing about your database is wrong.
Prisma never got as
far as connecting — it could not read the address you gave it. The middle of
that
message depends on your own password, so your neighbour's will not say the
same thing
as yours:  invalid port number ,  empty host ,  empty database name ,
whichever field
your password ran into first. The code is the same for all of them, and it
is the
code the question asks for. The last sentence is the whole diagnosis, and it
is the
sentence everybody skips: "certain characters must be escaped".If you got
either of the others: your URL is not correct. It is lucky. Do step 15
anyway, and read it twice — it is the more important of the two things to
take out of
today, and it is the one you would otherwise not find out about until it bit
you on a
machine you cannot easily get back into.
15. Here is why — and this step matters most to the four in five for whom it
worked.
DATABASE_URL  is a URL, and a URL has a grammar:
mysql://  USER  :  PASSWORD  @  HOST  :  PORT  /  DATABASE
The  :  ends the user, the  @  ends the password, the  /  ends the address —
and your
generated password is twenty characters drawn from an alphabet that contains
all three
of them, and  %  besides. What each does when it lands in the middle of a
password:
│
─────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/      │ ends the address. Everything after it is read as the database
│ name, the URL is broken, and you get the error printed at step
│ 14. About one generated password in five contains one.
%      │ begins an escape already, so the reader quietly decodes it and
│ hands MySQL a different password. No parse error at all — just
│  Access denied , which sends everybody off to inspect the
│ GRANT. Rare, and much the worst to find.
@   :  │ survive — this reader splits at the last  @  and the first
│  : , so the password comes back out whole. That is a property
│ of one library, not a rule of URLs.
So most of you got away with it, and getting away with it is not the same as
being
right: the next thing that reads that URL is perfectly entitled to split at
the first
@  instead, and then your password is one character long and your host is
nonsense.The fix is percent-encoding: every awkward character is replaced by
%  and its
number, so that it can appear in a field without ending it. Do it whether or
not
yours failed.Encode the example password  p@ss:w/rd  and read what comes out.
What does the encoder
print? →  T15
$ python3 -c 'import sys,urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.
argv[1], safe=""))' 'p@ss:w/rd'
<...>
Now do the same with your own password — and take it from the file rather
than from
your notes, so that it is never on a command line at all:
$ set -a; . /srv/school/db/school.env; set +a
$ python3 -c 'import os,urllib.parse as u; print("mysql://%s:%s@127.0.0.
1:3306/%s" % (
os.environ["SCHOOL_USER"], u.quote(os.environ["SCHOOL_PASSWORD"],
safe=""),
os.environ["SCHOOL_DATABASE"]))'
<...>
$ nano .env
That prints the whole finished line. Put it in  .env  as
DATABASE_URL="<that>" .The example above needed single quotes round
p@ss:w/rd  because it was typed at the
shell; your own password never is. It goes from the file into Python's
environment and
out again, and the shell never looks at it — which is one entire class of
mistake that
cannot happen.  db/school.env  still holds the raw password and must keep
holding it;
the encoded copy lives here in  .env  and nowhere else.Encode it once. Run
the encoder on an already-encoded password and  %40  becomes
%2540 . You then have a wrong password and no error message that says so —
just
Access denied , which sends everybody looking at the GRANT instead.Nothing
about this is Prisma, or Node, or MySQL. It is the URL grammar, and you will
meet it again in every connection string, every callback URL and every API
token you
ever put in a query parameter.
16. Run the same command again. Now the whole room gets the same thing: it
reads the URL,
it connects, it gets further — and refuses for a reason that has nothing to
do with
your password at all. Which error code this time? →  T16
$ npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Error: <...>
Prisma Migrate could not create the shadow database. Please make sure the
database
user has permission to create databases.
Original error: Error code: <...>
User was denied access on the database `prisma_migrate_shadow_db_2700f6fc-...
`
If that is the same code you wrote down at step 14, it is a real answer and
not a
mistake — it means your URL parsed the first time and you were already
standing here.
Write it down again.Nothing is broken, and do not fix this by granting more
privileges. migrate dev  is a developer's command: it works out what changed
in the schema and
writes a new migration, and to do that safely it builds a scratch copy of
your database
first. Your application's user cannot create databases — because you scoped
it in step 6,
correctly. The failure is your least-privilege grant working exactly as
intended.And there is a second thing wrong with it, which the error cannot
tell you. That
command exists to write a schema. You already have one: you built it in Part
2, from
schema.sql , before this application was ever started. Even with every
privilege in the
server it would be the wrong command — you are not developing this schema,
you are
deploying against it. Give a tool more power to make an error go away and
you have
hidden a question you should have asked.
17. So stop trying to make a schema you already have. Ask the other question
instead:
does the database match what this code expects? Prisma will answer it
directly, and
it answers with an exit code as well as with words. What did it print, and
what would a
non-zero exit have meant? →  T17
$ npx prisma migrate diff \
--from-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma \
--to-schema-datamodel   prisma/schema.prisma \
--exit-code
<...>
$ echo $?
<...>
Read the two  --from / --to  options as a sentence: from what the datasource
actually contains, to what the datamodel in  schema.prisma  describes. The
answer is
the work that would have to be done to the database to make the two agree —
so no work
means they already agree. --exit-code  is what makes this more than a thing
to look at.  0  for no difference,
2  for a difference, and a number is something a deployment script can act
on at three
in the morning when nobody is reading the output. This is the command you
run before
you start an application, not after it has failed.You built that table by
hand in Part 2, out of  schema.sql , and Prisma has just
confirmed that what you built is exactly what the code was written against.
That is the
whole of this flow: the database is owned by the database scripts; the
application is
a client that checks its assumptions and then gets on with it.Try it against
a database that has drifted and you get the difference itemised —
[*] Changed the students table ,  [+] Added column … . Worth knowing what
it looks
like, because that is the output that tells you why an application that
worked yesterday
does not today.
18. Last piece: build the client the application's code imports.
$ npx prisma generate
✔ Generated Prisma Client (v6.19.3) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in
63ms
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"  in  server.js  imports code
that does
not exist until this command writes it — generated from  schema.prisma ,
into
node_modules , on this machine. It is not in the repository and it is not
in the
archive, which is why deploying an application is never only copying files.

### Part 4 - Run it as a service

The misconception this part attacks: none — you know this one. This is class
2's
int134-heartbeat.service  again, except that this time the thing you are
handing to
systemd is a real application with a database behind it. That is the point:
the mechanism
does not grow with the program, and you write this unit the way you wrote
that one.

19. Write  /etc/systemd/system/school-api.service , and tell systemd to re-
read its units.The three sections are class 2's, and so are  Description= ,
User= ,  ExecStart= ,
Restart=  and  WantedBy= . Three directives are new:
Directive           │ Section     │ What it does
─────────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────
After=             │  [Unit]     │ Start this only once the units named
│             │ here have started
WorkingDirectory=  │  [Service]  │ The directory to run the program
│             │ from
EnvironmentFile=   │  [Service]  │ A file of  KEY=value  lines to hand
│             │ the program
It must run the backend's  server.js  under  node , from the  backend
directory, as
sysadmin , taking its configuration from the file you wrote in step 13,
restarting
always, ordered after the network and the database, and installable into
multi-user.target .Fill in every  <...> . The lines already written out are
given to you — copy them
as they stand:
[Unit]
Description=<...>
After=network-online.target <...>

[Service]
User=<...>
WorkingDirectory=<...>
EnvironmentFile=<...>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node <...>
Restart=<...>
RestartSec=5

# The service reads its code and its configuration; it has no reason to
write
# anywhere on this machine, and saying so costs nothing.
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=read-only

[Install]
WantedBy=<...>

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
WorkingDirectory=  is why  ExecStart=  can end in a bare filename — systemd
runs the
program from that directory. The interpreter still needs its absolute path.
Class 2's
rule has not moved: systemd expands no  ~ , and has no idea what directory
you were in. EnvironmentFile=  is how the configuration you wrote in step 13
reaches the program —
systemd reads it and hands it over as environment variables. The
application's own
code never opens that file and never mentions its name, which is why the
same code runs
unchanged in a container in class 8 with the same values supplied a
completely different
way. It names the file, not the directory holding it.(One honest
complication, in case you meet it: if you run  node server.js  by hand from
that directory, it works — because the Prisma library looks for a  .env
beside it as a
convenience for developers. That is the library, not this application, and
it is why the
file is called  .env  rather than anything else. systemd is not relying on
it.) After=  orders startup. It does not wait for MySQL to be ready to
answer, which is
what  Restart=always  is really for.Leave  User=  out and the service runs
as  root . A web application reachable from the
network is exactly the kind of program that should not, and the checker
looks. RestartSec=  is how long systemd waits before restarting. Without it
a program that
fails instantly is restarted as fast as the machine can manage, which turns
one broken
deployment into a busy machine.The four after the comment are sandboxing,
and they are given to you because they
are not class 4's subject — but they are what separates a service from a
program you
happened to start.  NoNewPrivileges=  stops it ever gaining privilege it did
not start
with;  PrivateTmp=  gives it its own  /tmp  so it cannot read anyone else's;
and the
two  Protect  lines make the operating system and the home directories read-
only to it.
None of them changes what your application does. All of them shrink what it
can do to
this machine if somebody else ever gets to decide what it runs — which is
the whole
reason the database user was scoped in Part 2, applied one layer up.
systemctl show school-api -p NoNewPrivileges  will tell you afterwards
whether
systemd read the line the way you meant it.There is no finished unit file on
this machine to copy — not in the archive, not
under  /srv/school . The skeleton above and the requirements are what you
have, and
that is deliberate: you write this one in class so that you can write the
next one, on
your noticeboard, on your own.
20. Enable and start it — one command does both. Then ask the two questions
separately,
the way class 2 taught you: is it enabled, and is it active?
# enable it and start it in the one command
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/school-api.
service → /etc/systemd/system/school-api.service.

# then the two states, one after the other
enabled
active
enabled  answers "will it come back after a reboot";  active  answers "is
it running
now". Class 2 separated them for a reason and today is the payoff: the
service you just
wrote can be one without the other, and only one of those is a working
deployment.
21. Read the service's log — class 2's command, this unit's name, and the
last few lines is
enough. The application prints one line as it starts, saying where it is
listening.
Check that the port is yours.
# the last few lines of this unit's log
Aug 26 14:31:51 lvm68136 systemd[1]: Started school-api.service - <the
description you wrote>.
Aug 26 14:31:52 lvm68136 node[269799]: cors: disabled (CORS_ORIGIN is not
set)
Aug 26 14:31:52 lvm68136 node[269799]: school api listening on 0.0.0.
0:3136
No  sudo . You are in the  adm  group, which is what lets you read another
service's
journal at all — worth knowing the day you are on a machine where you are
not.If it says  3100 , your  .env  has no  PORT  line and the application
fell back to its
own default. That default is deliberately nobody's correct answer: it starts,
so what
you get is a check that tells you which port it wanted rather than a service
that will
not run at all.The application writes to its standard output and systemd
puts that in the journal —
the same mechanism as your heartbeat script in class 2. It writes no log
file of its
own, deliberately: in class 6 the very same output appears in  docker logs .
22. Ask the API whether it is alive.
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<your port>/api/health
{"ok":true,"student":"<your student number>","time":"2026-08-26T07:31:54.
959Z"}
A health endpoint exists so that something other than a human can ask "is
this
working?". You will point a container at one in class 9.If  student  is
empty,  STUDENT_ID  is missing from  .env . Fix it, then
sudo systemctl restart school-api  — the file is read once, at start.
23. Now use the API properly. Read the register, add yourself to it, then
deliberately post
one with a field missing. What status does the last one come back with? →
T23
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<your port>/api/students

$ curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"studentId":"<your student number>","firstName":"<your name>",
"lastName":"<your surname>","major":"IT"}' \
http://127.0.0.1:<your port>/api/students

$ curl -s -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"studentId":"99999999999"}' \
http://127.0.0.1:<your port>/api/students | head -1
HTTP/1.1 <...>
This is how a deployment engineer meets an API: not by reading about REST,
but by
asking a running one for something and reading what it says back.  curl
never enforces
anything a browser would — it is the honest view of what the server does.
Send the same student twice and you get a third answer again. Try it, and
try
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:<your port>/api/students/99999999999  as
well. Four
different situations, four different status codes, and none of them is the
server
breaking.
24. Restart  school-api , then ask the API for the register again. Are you
still on it?
→  T24 This is the step the whole afternoon is built towards. In class 3 the
Add button
could not work at all. Now it works, and what you added outlives the program
that
accepted it, because the program is not where it lives.
25. Your API is listening on every address, but nobody outside can reach it
yet — the same
situation as class 3,  lab03class  step 13. Let your port through the
firewall, read
the rules back to check it took, and then try the address below from your
own computer.
Does it answer? →  T25
# allow your own port in, then read the rules back
Rule added

http://<your-vm>.sit.kmutt.ac.th:<your port>/api/health
You have now opened two ports on this machine. In class 5 you will close
this one
again, on purpose, and the application will keep working at
http://<your-vm>.sit.kmutt.ac.th/school/  — which is the argument for the
thing class
5 is about.
